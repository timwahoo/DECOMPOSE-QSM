# DECOMPOSE-QSM
A Susceptibililty Source Separation QSM method

The original method Decompose quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) to sub-voxel diamagnetic and paramagnetic components based on gradient-echo MRI data https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8720043/

Alternative Method thisrepository follows closely is Distinguishing microgliosis and tau deposition in the mouse brain using paramagnetic and diamagnetic susceptibility source separation https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11042227/
